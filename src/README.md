tokenizerProgram
====================
# DESCRIPTION:

The *tokenizerProgram* is a program that is meant to tokenize a string of
words and maintain the history of all strings inputted during the duration of
the program. Its workings are similar to that of the split function seen in
other programming languages such as Java or Python. In this program, the user
will input a string, this string is then tokenized, or rather split by the
spaces. The program will return the split words after the user has pressed
'enter' after the input symbol has been prompted. This string is then
maintained in the history of the program and can be called at any time. The
history will show all strings that have been inputted to the program. In
addition, this program can return the string that was tokenized at a certain
ID in the history. For more information on how to compile and run the program,
refer to the headings below.
